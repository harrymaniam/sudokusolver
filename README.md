# sudokusolver
Recursive backtracking sudoku solver in Java

The purpose of this project was to create a Sudoku Solver in Java that is easy to understand for those who
are learning recursion/Java. There are few optimizations that can be done to make this code run more efficiently but I have left
them out to keep this code as easy to understand as possible. 

However, there is a much more efficient solution using Knuths Algorithm X and Dancing Links Data Structure 
that I hope to implement and put on here soon so stay tuned.

<h1>Instructions</h1>
*Create a text file with characters from 0-9 seperated by spaces and newlines for each row
*Use the character '0' to represent an empty cell
*modify the path in the main file from "/Users/harry/Documents/workspace/sudokusolver/src/sudokusolver/grid.txt"
to whatever path your textfile is stored in
*Hit run and the solution wil be printed
